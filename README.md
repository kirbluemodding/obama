Super Mario Bros. Wonder level editor with help from shibboleet, Miguel, troy, and Kirblue. 

# Current Version/Early Alpha
This tool is currently in an early alpha state, as:
1. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is not released as of yet, and we will not be using ANY provided leaks and such.
2. There will need to be a bunch of testing done to figure out sprites, settings, etc.

# Update V0.0.1
- Created Github page
- Logo and Icon created
- Basic framework
